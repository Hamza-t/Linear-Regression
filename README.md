## Content
 
### Lab1 :  Linear regression course

* Linear Regression is the simplest algorithm in machine learning, it can be trained in different ways. In this notebook we will cover the following linear algorithms:

1. Linear Regression
2. Robust Regression
3. Ridge Regression
4. LASSO Regression
5. Bayesian Regression
6. Poisson Regression
7. Elastic Net
8. Polynomial Regression
9. Stochastic Gradient Descent
